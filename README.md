# Open Galaxy At War
*Hello and welcome to a little project of mine called* **Open Galaxy at War**
As the title implies this project is open source. I have started **completely**
from scratch. Anyways, Galaxy at war is a game I have **fond** memories of. **Mostly.**
(WIP)
# Roadmap/checklist thingy
- Find a suitable host service
- Create a user portal for signups/logins/password resets etc
- Research game mechanics.
- (WIP)/will add more when needed.

# Game Mechanic Documentation:
Will be part of this repository!
